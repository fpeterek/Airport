# Airport Simulation

An airport simulation written in Kotlin. Currently a work in progress, when finished, the airport should have working ATC, 
perfectly capable of controlling air traffic and safely guiding and landing aircraft. Aircraft and ATC should take into 
account weather, emergency situations, wake turbulence and other things and prevent aircraft from crashing into one another 
both on ground and in the air. The ATC should also be capable of handling situations such as temporarily closed runways, 
opening of new runways, etc.
